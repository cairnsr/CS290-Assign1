<h3> Question 1</h3>
<p> The hardest part of this assignment was that initial set up, and figuring out where to post everything. </p>
<p> Looking at Piazza helped answer many of these questions and now I think I have it set up right. </p>
<h3> Question 2</h3>
<p> I learned how to set up code using GitHub and write html code. </p>
<p> Before this class I dodnt know how to do any of that </p>
<h3> Question 3</h3>
<p> Piazza was most helpful with this assignment. </p>
<p> A lot of the questions I had my classmates had as well, so reading through those helped a lot. </p>
